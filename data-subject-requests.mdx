## How It Works

The Data Subject Requests tool integrates with Genesys Cloud's GDPR APIs to provide a seamless experience:

- Subject Identification: The tool searches for subjects across Genesys Cloud using identifiers like user ID, email, or name
- Request Submission: Selected request types are processed through appropriate GDPR API endpoints
- Processing: The system handles the request, which may include:
  - Collecting all relevant user data (for export requests)
  - Removing specified user data (for deletion requests)
  - Updating user information (for update requests)
- Completion: Results are presented to the user with appropriate documentation
- Record Keeping: All actions are logged for compliance and audit purposes

All operations are executed with appropriate security controls and audit trails to maintain compliance with GDPR requirements.
