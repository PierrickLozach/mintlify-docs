The Security, Privacy & Compliance (SPC) Portal allows you to access specialized tools created by the Genesys Security, Privacy & Compliance Center of Excellence team. Here's how to log in:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon='cloud' title='I am a Genesys direct customer or a Genesys partner'>
    This section is for Genesys **direct** customers and partners who have a Genesys Cloud organization. Genesys **indirect** customers are currently not supported.

    <Note>The first user who logs in needs **administrator** privileges across all divisions within Genesys Cloud. The administrator requires, at minimum, the **General/Admin (All Divisions)** permission.</Note>

    If you are not an administrator of your Genesys Cloud organization, please contact your organization's administrator to perform the initial set up and invite you to the SPC Portal.

      <Accordion icon="gear" title="Perform the initial setup">

        <AccordionGroup>
            When the first administrator logs in, they will have access to the Admin panel. As an administrator, you will need to:

            1. Request full portal access if not already granted
            2. Download the agreement file when prompted
            3. Contact your account executive to upgrade your tenant to the appropriate tier

            <Note>
              Administrator accounts will automatically receive all application roles when upgrading.
            </Note>

          <Accordion icon="puzzle-piece" title="Application Activation">
            As an administrator, you need to activate applications before regular users can access them:

            1. Navigate to the Admin panel
            2. Select the desired application
            3. Activate the trial or subscription
            4. Open the application at least once to complete initialization

            Some applications may require additional permissions in Genesys Cloud to function properly.

          <Accordion icon="users-gear" title="Assigning Roles to Users">

            2. Select the user you want to modify
            3. Assign the appropriate application roles based on their needs

            <Note>
              Regular users cannot access applications until an administrator assigns the proper roles to them.
            </Note>

          </Accordion>

          <Accordion icon="envelope" title="Inviting other users">
